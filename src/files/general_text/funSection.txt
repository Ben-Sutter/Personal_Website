This was going to be the section where I shared a few hobbies, interests, and a fun fact when I began this project, hoping to use my website as a way to stand out in an application (not that they would look, bffr).

Since I am not writing this as a branding tool anymore, I decided that as time goes on, I will try to make some new pages, hopefully programming cool features or making something fun that I want to share, idrk.
