Hi, my name is Ben. 

Earlier this year I was laid off and remained unemployed for four months. 
During that time, I told myself I would build a new website for my name's domain.
I now find myself two weeks into employment, finally getting to doing this, and I promise more is coming.

Feel free to check out what I have so far, I will continue to add things (at least that's what I am telling myself).

For the latest content check out the section marked "Latest" below.
Hopefully I will add some sort of thing below for you to see my latest posts/updates,commit history, or something, otherwise this is a lil awk
